Description
===========
In order to compare viewers we propose an adaptable evaluation framework that
considers different user profiles. The basis of the framework are a set of 
criteria weighted according to user needs.

Criteria can be decomposed in subcriteria and grouped in more general
categories making a multi-level hierarchical structure that can be analyzed
at different levels of detail to ease scores interpretation. In our case the 
considered categories are: technical, archive (open, save, and networking), 
workflow (the productivity and efficiency), visualization (volume rendering,
MPR, DICOM conformityâ€¦), tools (annotations and measures), other modalities,
and processing.

The evaluation framework is useful to understand and prioritize new development
goals, and can be easily adapted to express different needs by altering the
weights.

How to contribute
=================
You can contribute by making pull requests or sending us modified versions of
the spreadsheet with new viewers, criteria, etc.

Please, document the changes you do in order to ease the merging task.
